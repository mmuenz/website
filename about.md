<br>

- I'm Dr. MÃ¡rton MÃ¼nz, computational biologist and bioinformatician. ðŸ§¬

- At present, I'm a Senior Scientist and IT Director at [The Bioinformatics CRO](https://www.bioinformaticscro.com/), a global, distributed contract research company that specializes in providing computational biology services in the genomics space to small and medium-sized biotechnology companies. Previously, I worked as a consultant for [The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), London](https://www.icr.ac.uk/).

- I have a PhD in Bioinformatics from the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), and an MSc in Physics from [EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University (ELTE)](https://www.elte.hu/en/).

- My PhD thesis was about molecular dynamics, but in my current job I mostly deal with NGS (next-generation sequencing) data. You can read more about my work [here](/work).

- My broader interests include genomics, precision medicine, cloud computing, machine learning (AI), software development, entrepreneurship. I love [reading](/favs), [writing](/blog), and [coding](/coding).

- Some other topics that excite me are genealogy research, the history of computers and computing, the impact of technology on our lives, accelerated learning, and self development.

- Before doing science, I worked as a science journalist for daily and weekly newspapers in Hungary. I wrote about biomedicine, health, and the environment.

- Currently I live in Barcelona, Spain ðŸŒ´ with my wife, [Brigitta](https://www.brigittaboth.com/), a visual artist. Check out her collages and paintings [here](https://www.instagram.com/brigittaboth_artist/).

- I'm a creative and happy person. In my spare time, I enjoy going to restaurants, watching football (BarÃ§a!), reading contemporary fiction, walking in the city, people-watching, and visiting art exhibitions. I'm an introvert, but I value friendships more than anything.
