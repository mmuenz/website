Welcome to my /now page, a dynamic section on the website that offers a glimpse into my current focus, ongoing projects, and short-term goals. The list below will be kept up-to-date. This page has been inspired by web pages such as [this](https://sive.rs/now), [this](https://nownownow.com/about), and [this](https://hack.org/mc/now.html).

- Get certified by AWS: At The Bioinformatics CRO, our computational infrastructure is based on AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud. As IT Director, I've been responsible for managing our cloud computing resources for the past five years. I am currently intensively studying to pass the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) exam to further solidify and validate my AWS expertise.

- AWS cloud development: In addition to the cloud architect skills mentioned above, I'm currently learning topics in AWS cloud development, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and Terraform, as well as serverless application development.

- Continue learning web development: After learning Node.js, Express, and React (i.e. the MERN stack) for web application development recently, I'm planning to expand my web development knowledge by learning additional popular technologies: Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, and GraphQL.

- Learn AI development: I'm interested in integrating AI models, especially LLMs (Large Language Models), into some tools I'm creating. Therefore, I decided to learn AI development frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, and the OpenAI API. Having access to the powerful capabilities of AI from within my own Python and JavaScript code could open up many exciting possibilities.

- Learning more single-cell analysis: I am expanding my knowledge in single-cell sequencing data analysis, an area in bioinformatics that offers deeper insights into complex biological processes and diseases at a single-cell resolution. This is a rapidly evolving field with so much to learn and catch up on.

- Write more blog posts: I'm aiming to write a few more totally random blog posts for this website in the near future. Writing without restrictions feels really great. This website is my space, I will enjoy the freedom. ðŸ™‚
