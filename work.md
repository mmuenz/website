He has a rare ability to design complex, highly effective and efficient code that delivers exactly what is needed. Even rarer is his ability to communicate effortlessly with everyone; coders, scientists and clinicians. He takes the time to understand what is needed and then makes it happen, usually giving you solutions beyond your dreams. And his work is always comprehensively detailed and his software is always a delight to use. Martonâ€™s contributions to our disease gene discovery and translation projects were vital to our successes." - Nazneen Rahman, MD PhD, Professor of Human Genetics, Institute of Cancer Research, London</span>

I am a [Computational Biologist / Bioinformatician](/bioinformatics) specialized in NGS (Next-generation Sequencing) data analysis, HPC (High Performance Computing), and Cloud Computing. At present, I work for [The Bioinformatics CRO](https://www.bioinformaticscro.com/) as Senior Scientist and IT Director. Prior to that, I worked as a remote consultant for the [The Institute of Cancer Research, London](https://www.icr.ac.uk/).

Over the past 5 years, working as a Senior Scientist and IT Director for The Bioinformatics CRO, I have been involved in a wide range of activities:

- Bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, WES, WGS, and mass spectrometry immunopeptidomics data analysis
- Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) development
- Machine Learning (ML) projects
- NGS methods and pipelines development
- Variant annotation, interpretation, and data integration
- Managing the CRO's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure
- Data management
- Maintenance of HPC clusters
- User management and onboarding
- Leading software development projects (web apps, GUIs, databases, in-house automation tools)

Previously, between 2013 and 2018, I have worked as a postdoctoral researcher and later as a remote consultant for the Genetic Susceptibility Team at the Division of Genetics & Epidemiology of The Institute of Cancer Research, London in collaboration with the [Wellcome Center for Human Genetics, Oxford](https://www.chg.ox.ac.uk/):

- I have participated in two translational research programmes; the [Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics (MCG) programme](https://www.mcgprogramme.com/) and the [Transforming Genetic Medicine Initiative (TGMI)](http://www.thetgmi.org/).
- The focus of my work was developing a standardised system for clinical variant annotation in cancer predisposition genes, improving quality control of NGS data and implementing automated NGS data processing pipelines.
- The tools I have developed had been used at [The Royal Marsden Hospital, London](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/) for genetic testing of breast and ovarian cancer patients.
